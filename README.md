# Anomaly-Detection-Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Devices
Final project of the course Management and Analisys of Physical Dataset Module-B (MAPD-B) of the Physics of Data master degree at University of Padova.

## Description
Nowadays, IoT and Big Data allowed retrieving significant benefits from the devices' data sensors. Typically in the academic world, this means, the possibility to perform some analysis as time series forecasting, data predictions, and data classification. Despite this being extremely useful from the research side, from the enterprise point of view, the necessities are instead to exploit the huge amounts of data generated by devices, to perform some predictions for Anomaly detection and Predictive Maintenance. This project uses PySpark to manage a dataset of 5GB and analize some anomalies in the dataset.

## Language
Python. Spark
